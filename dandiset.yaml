description: 'Data was recorded using silicon probe electrodes in the frontal cortices
  of male Long Evans rats between 4-7 months of age. The design was to have no specific
  behavior, task or stimulus, rather the animal was left alone in it’s home cage (which
  it lives in at all

  times). Data includes both local field potentials (LFP) and spikes. 11 total animals,
  27 recording sessions, 1360 total units recorded, 1121 units considered stable,
  995 putative excitatory units and 126 putative inhibitory units. Only recordings
  including a “WAKE-SLEEP” episode wherein at least 7 minutes of wake are followed
  by 20 minutes of sleep. On average 2 such WAKE-SLEEP episodes per recording session. '
